To make sure your code or program works and is safe, test it often, use secure coding methods like checking inputs, and fix problems quickly. To understand what users need, talk to them, write down their needs clearly, and test the program with them. When designing software, plan first using simple diagrams, break the work into small parts, and follow good coding habits.
